## HealthAI – Smart Healthcare Web Application

### Overview
HealthAI is a healthcare-focused web application that I developed to explore how artificial intelligence can support basic health awareness and monitoring.  
The project helps users understand common symptoms, keep track of health-related data, and follow healthier routines using a simple and user-friendly interface.

### Why this project?
Many people delay medical attention because they are unsure whether their symptoms are serious.  
This project aims to provide **initial guidance and awareness**, not medical diagnosis, by combining basic AI logic with full-stack development.

### What HealthAI Does
- Allows users to enter symptoms and get basic AI-based health suggestions  
- Stores health-related data securely for future reference  
- Helps users track medicines and daily health habits  
- Encourages preventive care and healthy lifestyle choices  

---

### Key Features
- AI-based symptom guidance  
- Health data storage and tracking  
- Medicine reminder support  
- Clean and simple user interface  
- Secure user authentication  

---

### Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- Database: MongoDB  
- AI / Logic: Python, basic Machine Learning concepts  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman
